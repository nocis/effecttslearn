# Basics

lazy and immutable, like function

normally we have this kind of program:

data -> res1 = fun1(data)
-> res2 = fun2(res1)
...
-> final = finFun(prevRes)

which means we chain a lot func to process data!

and we want to handle errors for each step!!
=> which is effect does

# chain problem

chaining! big class, unable to treeshake!!!
const program2 = () => new MyDate().double().toString().toUpperCase();

# happy path programing

const after = Effect.gen(function* (\_) {
// x is a number!, 'yield' is like 'await'
const x = yield* _(Effect.sync(() => Date.now()));
const y = x * 2;
const z = yield* _(divide(y, 3));
// notice how errors propagate automatically to the return type
return z.toString();
});
